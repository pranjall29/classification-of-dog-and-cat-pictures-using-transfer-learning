# Classification-of-dog-and-cat-pictures-using-transfer-learning
## Overview
transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.
In this project, a mobilenet_V2 model is used and on top of that dropout and activation layers are deployed to classify cat and dog pictures.
